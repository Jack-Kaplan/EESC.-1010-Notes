\section{Introduction}
Volcanic activity poses significant hazards to human life, property, and the environment. Understanding these hazards and implementing effective mitigation strategies is crucial for minimizing their impact. This document explores the various types of volcanic hazards, their associated damages, and the methods available to mitigate these effects. Additionally, it provides a detailed comparison between the two primary types of volcanoes: \textbf{Shield Volcanoes} and \textbf{Composite Volcanoes}.

\section{Types of Volcanoes}
Understanding the different types of volcanoes is fundamental to comprehending their behavior, associated hazards, and appropriate mitigation strategies. The two primary types discussed here are \textbf{Shield Volcanoes} and \textbf{Composite Volcanoes}.

\subsection{Shield Volcanoes}
\textbf{Shield Volcanoes} are characterized by their broad, gently sloping sides resembling a defensive shield. They are primarily built by the eruption of low-viscosity lava that can flow long distances.

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*, label={--}]
    \item \textbf{Appearance:} Broad and gently sloping, resembling a defensive shield.
    \item \textbf{Dimensions:} Wider than they are tall, leading to a dome-like structure.
    \item \textbf{Example:} \textit{Mauna Loa} in Hawaii, the largest volcano in the world.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Composite Volcanoes}
\textbf{Composite Volcanoes}, also known as stratovolcanoes, are steep and cone-shaped, similar to an ice cream cone turned upside down. They are built by the eruption of high-viscosity lava that does not flow as easily, leading to the accumulation of lava and pyroclastic materials.

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*, label={--}]
    \item \textbf{Appearance:} Steep and cone-shaped, similar to an ice cream cone turned upside down.
    \item \textbf{Dimensions:} Height is comparable to their width, resulting in a more symmetrical, conical shape.
    \item \textbf{Example:} \textit{Mount Rainier} near Seattle, Washington.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Comparison of Shield and Composite Volcanoes}
The following table summarizes the key differences between Shield and Composite Volcanoes:

\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\section{Volcanic Hazards}
Volcanic activity can produce a range of hazards that impact human life, infrastructure, and the environment. The primary hazards discussed here include \textbf{Lava Flows}, \textbf{Volcanic Ash}, \textbf{Pyroclastic Flows}, and \textbf{Volcanic Gases}.

\subsection{Lava Hazards}
Lava flows are streams of molten rock that emerge during volcanic eruptions. These flows can cause significant damage due to their heat, density, and mobility.

\subsubsection{Types of Damage Caused by Lava}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Property Destruction:} Lava can burn or bury structures, including those made of brick or concrete.
    \item \textbf{Fire Hazards:} Intense heat from lava can ignite combustible materials without direct contact.
    \item \textbf{Infrastructure Damage:} Lava can block harbors, roads, and railways, disrupting essential services and trade routes.
    \item \textbf{Farmland Loss:} Lava solidifies into barren rock, permanently covering fertile land.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Mitigation Strategies for Lava Damage}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Avoid High-Risk Areas:} Avoid building in valleys, as lava tends to flow downhill and follow natural low-lying paths.
    \item \textbf{Lava Redirection:} Construct barriers, mounds, and channels to divert lava away from critical infrastructure.
    \item \textbf{Cooling with Water:} Spray water onto advancing lava to cool and solidify it, slowing its progress.
    \item \textbf{Lava Flow Diversion:} Use earth-moving equipment to create pathways or barriers that guide lava away from populated areas.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Volcanic Ash Hazards}
Volcanic ash consists of fine particles of pulverized rock, minerals, and volcanic glass expelled during eruptions. It poses hazards over wide areas, often far from the eruption site.

\subsubsection{Types of Damage Caused by Volcanic Ash}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Respiratory Issues:} Ash inhalation can cause coughing, lung irritation, and suffocation at high concentrations.
    \item \textbf{Agricultural Damage:} Ash can block sunlight, contaminate water supplies, and devastate crops.
    \item \textbf{Mechanical Failures:} Ash can clog machinery and engines, as in the BE Flight 009 incident, where volcanic ash shut down all four engines mid-flight.
    \item \textbf{Structural Collapse:} Ash accumulation on roofs can lead to collapses due to its density—about three times that of snow.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Mitigation Strategies for Ash Damage}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Avoid Exposure:} Remain indoors with doors and windows sealed during ashfall.
    \item \textbf{Protect Respiratory Health:} Use masks or wet cloths to filter out ash particles.
    \item \textbf{Protect Vehicles:} Avoid driving through ashfall to prevent engine damage.
    \item \textbf{Strengthen Structures:} Implement building codes that require roofs to support ash accumulation.
    \item \textbf{Ash Removal:} Regularly remove ash from rooftops and other surfaces to prevent structural damage.
\end{itemize}

\begin{table}[h]

\caption{Comparison of Volcanic Ash and Snow}
\begin{tabular}{@{}lll@{}}
\toprule
\textbf{Property}         & \textbf{Volcanic Ash} & \textbf{Snow} \\ \midrule
Density (g/cm$^3$)        & 0.7--1.2               & 0.1--0.3      \\
Weight (per inch)         & 3$\times$ heavier      & Lighter        \\
Impact on Structures      & High risk of collapse  & Lower risk     \\ \bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\subsection{Pyroclastic Flows and Gases}
Pyroclastic flows are high-speed avalanches of hot gases, ash, and rock fragments. These flows, along with volcanic gases, are among the deadliest volcanic phenomena.

\subsubsection{Types of Damage Caused by Pyroclastic Flows}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Incineration:} Temperatures exceeding 1,000°C can ignite or destroy everything in their path.
